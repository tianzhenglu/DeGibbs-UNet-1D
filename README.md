U-Net convolutional network to remove Gibbs noise in 1D time signal

Author: Tianzheng Lu        


INTRODUCTION

This U-Net is proposed to eliminate noise introduced by Gibb's phenoemon in the Fourier series. Traditional filters such as $\sigma$ approximation smooth the signal, while in the author's application[1] smoothing the signal leads to extra error. Thus author tried convolutional neural network to solve this problem.
